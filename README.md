# image-denoising
Objective:  
            The generator aims to produce data that is indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator aims to correctly classify real and fake data.

  The generator and discriminator are trained in a minimax game framework:
                             The generator tries to minimize the probability of the discriminator correctly classifying its outputs as fake.
The discriminator tries to maximize its accuracy in discriminating between real and fake data.

We trained our network using div2k data set consists of 800 2k images
During training, ILR is generated by first applying a Gaussian filter to IHR, followed by a down-sampling operation  with downsampling factor r = 4. 
For each mini-batch we crop 16 random 96 96 HR sub images of distinct training images
We employed the trained MSE-based SRResNet network as initialization for the generator when training the actual GAN to avoid undesired local optima.
Now our gan is trained for 320 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-4 with a combination of mse loss, perceptual loss and adversial loss.
